# My Personal Homebrew Formulae and Casks

This is my personal collection of Homebrew formulae and casks that, for various
reasons, are not available on either
[homebrew/homebrew-core](https://github.com/homebrew/homebrew-core) or
[homebrew/homebrew-cask](https://github.com/homebrew/homebrew-cask).

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install mahyarmirrashed/mahyarmirrashed/<formula>`

Or `brew tap mahyarmirrashed/mahyarmirrashed` and then `brew install <formula>`.

Or, in a `brew bundle` `Brewfile`:

```ruby
tap "mahyarmirrashed/mahyarmirrashed"
brew "<formula>"
```

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check
[Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
